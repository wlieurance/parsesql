Description: This package contains contains the the sql_parser R6 class which 
    will read a character string or a file, parse the SQL according to 
    individual character states (default, comment, quoted, etc.), and split the 
    statements by default-state semicolons (i.e. those not found in quotes or 
    comments) found in the string into two statement vectors. One statement 
    vector (class variable 'sql') can be use to execute individual statements 
    and the second vector (class variable 'formatted') can be use to see the 
    SQL statement formatted by state type.  The class also accepts a 'params' 
    variable which can used to glue parameters into SQL statements before 
    processing.
